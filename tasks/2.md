# Task 2. Sorting

Implement your own optimized numeric array sorting algorithm (that will use < as a comparison predicate) to compete in the sorting algorithms contest for the fastest sort.

You can use base your code on one or the combination of the basic algorithms provided in [sort.lisp](sort.lisp) or implement your own version from scratch. The file [sort.lisp](sort.lisp) also contains the basic code for measuring the time of the algorithm operation on a random, sorted and reverse sorted arrays that will be used in the contest evaluation.
